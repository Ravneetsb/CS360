    <div id="bad"></div>
    <p>This chart is bad because: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>There is no title in this chart.</li>
        <li>There is no context for who the dots represent</li>
        <li>There is no color scale. It is impossible to tell which penguins belong to which species.</li>
    </ul>
    <div id="good"></div>
    <p>This chart is a redesigned version. It is better because: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>It has an informative title.</li>
        <li>It shows that there are different species.</li>
        <li>There is a color legend.</li>
    </ul>
